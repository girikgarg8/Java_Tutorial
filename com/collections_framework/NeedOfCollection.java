        //problem with array is that it's size is fixed, cannot be changed, also an array can only have homogeneous data
        //also ready made APIs support is not available in arrays: this means that When it's said that "ready-made APIs support is not available for arrays in Java," it means that there are no built-in libraries or classes in Java that provide support for arrays out of the box. In Java, arrays are a low-level data structure that are not directly supported by any specific API. Instead, arrays must be used in combination with other classes and libraries to perform operations such as sorting, searching, and manipulating elements.

// This means that if you want to perform any array-related operations in Java, you must write your own code to do so, or find a third-party library that provides the functionality you need. For example, you can use the Arrays class from the Java Standard Library to sort an array, or use the ArrayList class to manipulate an array as a dynamic list.


        //So collections frameworks helps us to solve these problems
        int []array= new int[10000];

    }
