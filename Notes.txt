How it works in Java?
Source code converted to bytecode (sequences of 0's and 1's) by compiler, and then Java virtual machine (JVM) reads the bytecode

Name of Interface must be an adjective: like Runable,Readable,Remote etc

Class name must be noun like Student, Person,Computer,Hashmap etc

Method name mut be verb like actionPerfomrmed,run,print,write

By default 0 is taken as the  value for int etc ratherthan garbage values

Main method is static because in java, to call a mathod we need an object, but we don't have an object at the start of our program so we create a static method and static methods don't require an object to be called

We cannot use a non-static variable in a static block
